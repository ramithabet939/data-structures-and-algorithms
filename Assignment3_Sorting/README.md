# Assignment 3 - Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository contains the solutions for **Assignment 3** of the Data Structures & Algorithms course. All programs are implemented in **Java**. The assignment focuses on sorting algorithms, dual heaps, binary search trees, symbol tables, and linked-list manipulations.

---

## **Question 1 - QuickSort with Step Tracking**
**File:** `QuickSortStepTracker.java`  
**Description:**  
- Implements a **three-way QuickSort** for strings with duplicate values.  
- Tracks **passes and steps** during the sorting process.  
- Prints the current state of the array after each swap.

---

## **Question 2 - Enhanced QuickSort**
**File:** `EnhancedQuickSort.java`  
**Description:**  
- Implements an **enhanced QuickSort** handling duplicates efficiently.  
- Uses leftEqual and rightEqual pointers to group duplicates.  
- Displays the array after each scan during the sorting process.

---

## **Question 3 - Dual Heap Priority Queue**
**File:** `DualHeapPriorityQueue.java`  
**Description:**  
- Implements a **dual heap** priority queue using arrays.  
- Supports **add, min, max, removeMin, removeMax** operations.  
- Maintains a **min-heap** and a **max-heap** simultaneously.

---

## **Question 4 - Binary Heap Sort on File Records**
**File:** `FileRecordHeapSort.java`  
**Description:**  
- Reads **DVRecord objects** from a file and sorts them using **binary heap sort**.  
- Writes both **unsorted** and **sorted** records to files.  
- Demonstrates file I/O with **sorting algorithms**.

---

## **Question 5 - GPA Calculator with BST Symbol Table**
**File:** `GPA_BST.java`  
**Description:**  
- Uses a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** as a symbol table to map **letter grades to GPA values**.  
- Accepts multiple grades as input and calculates the **average GPA**.  
- Demonstrates **BST insertion and lookup** operations.

---

## **Question 6 - Linked List Symbol Table**
**File:** `LinkedListSymbolTable.java`  
**Description:**  
- Implements a **symbol table** using a **sorted linked list**.  
- Supports **add, remove, search, contains**, and iteration over keys.  
- Provides an **iterable interface** for the keys.

---

## **Technologies & Tools**
- **Language:** Java  
- **IDE / Tools:** VS Code, Eclipse, or any Java IDE  
- **Concepts Covered:**  
  - Sorting algorithms (QuickSort, HeapSort)  
  - Data structures (BST, linked list, heap, dual heap)  
  - File I/O  
  - Symbol tables  
  - Iterators and generic programming
