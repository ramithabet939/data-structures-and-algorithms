# Assignment 2 - Data Structures & Algorithms (Java)

This repository contains my solutions for **Assignment 2** of the Data Structures & Algorithms course. Each question focuses on different algorithms and data structure manipulations, including array sorting, linked list shuffling, and custom ranking systems.

## **Question 1: Score Sorter**
**File:** `ScoreSorter.java`  

**Problem:**  
Rearrange an array of scores so that all even numbers are moved to the end while keeping odd numbers in front.  

**Key Concepts:**  
- Recursion  
- Array manipulation  
- Conditional swapping  

**Sample Input/Output:**  
Before Sorting: [85, 72, 91, 88, 77, 64, 95, 90, 81, 66]
After Sorting: [85, 91, 77, 95, 81, 66, 90, 64, 88, 72]

## **Question 2: Sublinear Merge Sort**
**File:** `SublinearMergeSort.java`  

**Problem:**  
Perform sublinear merge sort by dividing an array into blocks of size M, sorting each block with selection sort, and then merging the blocks in place.  

**Key Concepts:**  
- Divide and conquer  
- Selection sort  
- In-place merging  

**Sample Input/Output:**  
Original array: [9, 4, 7, 2, 8, 1, 5, 6]
Sorted array: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

## **Question 3: Employee Rankings**
**File:** `EmployeeRankings.java`  

**Problem:**  
Given an array of employee scores, determine each employee's ranking in ascending order of scores.  

**Key Concepts:**  
- Merge sort  
- Custom object sorting  
- Index mapping  

**Sample Input/Output:**  
Scores: [9, 10, 5]
Rankings: [1, 2, 0]

## **Question 4: Linked List Shuffle**
**File:** `LinkedListShuffle.java`  

**Problem:**  
Shuffle a singly linked list randomly using a recursive divide-and-merge approach.  

**Key Concepts:**  
- Linked list manipulation  
- Recursion  
- Randomized algorithms  

**Sample Input/Output:**  
Original List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> null
Shuffled List: 3 -> 1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> null

*Note: Actual output may vary due to randomness.*

## **Question 5: Time Sorter**
**File:** `TimeSorter.java`  

**Problem:**  
Sort an array of `Time` objects in ascending order (HH:MM:SS) and check for duplicates.  

**Key Concepts:**  
- Comparable interface  
- Custom object sorting  
- Array and equality checks  

**Sample Input/Output:**  
Input Times: 12 30 15, 09 45 10, 12 30 15
Sorted Times: 09:45:10, 12:30:15, 12:30:15
There are duplicate times.
